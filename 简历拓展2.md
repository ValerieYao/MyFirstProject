# Chowbus

## Description

Chowbus is a food ordering platform like Uber Eats or Door dash. The restaurant in this application is mainly Asian foods.

My team and I are responsible for developing, optimizing, and maintaining the application overall. I participated in developing the delivery module, fraud detection module and data support. I developed a set of RESTful APIs for these modules in the application. The tech stack I used in this project includes Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate, MySQL, Maven, Git, Redis and Junit.

For the **delivery module**, the system will assign each order to a nearby driver, who will then be given the system-designed delivery route. When orders are accepted or updated, drivers and customers will receive notifications, and the status of orders and drivers will be updated in real-time.

For the **fraud detection** module, we created a dashboard. The dashboard was designed to analyze customer data and detect suspicious activities, such as a high volume of transactions or a sudden change in spending habits. The integrated fraud detection service then automatically blocked those accounts to prevent further fraudulent activities. This led to a drastic reduction in fraud activities.  For instance, the dashboard was able to detect a customer who had recently moved to a new country and had attempted to purchase a series of very expensive items using their new credit card. 

## Questions

### Challenge?

#### Delivery - Redis

The delivery module refreshes order and delivery information too slowly, so we use Redis to cache the data. We can then process data quickly and reliably after using Redis because data is cached in memory rather than on disk, making it accessible in milliseconds.

#### Data - Index

I am responsible for generating data to support the BI team or the machine learning team. Sometimes database queries are slow. To solve this problem, I will use indexes. Depending on the select clause, I will create a composite index or a normal index. In the case of index invalidation, I'll examine the reasons with the explain function.

### Shortcoming?

For the frad detection module, there are still some drawbacks to this system. For example, if a customer's credit card is stolen and used for fraudulent activities, the customer may be unfairly accused and have their account frozen. This can be a major inconvenience and may cause the customer to take their business elsewhere.

## Details

### SDLC | agile/scrum

**Participate in the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC) using agile/scrum, including performance analysis, design, development, testing, and maintenance.** 

An agile/scrum methodology provides a framework for delivering software in short iterations and allows for frequent feedback and adjustments to the software. This allows for more efficient development and higher product quality, as each step of the SDLC is tailored to the specific needs of the product and tested before moving on to the next step.

### Spring Framwork

**Developed and maintained the delivery function for the application using Java 8 under Spring Framework including Spring MVC, Spring Security, Spring JPA, Maven, etc.** 

I used Spring MVC to develop the web architecture layer of the application, as well as Spring Security to ensure secure access to the application.

### Redis

**Utilized Redis to manage the real-time state of orders and drivers.** 

Redis is an in-memory data structure store that is used to store data in a key-value format, and its data is cached in memory rather than on disk, making it accessible and retrievable in milliseconds. This makes it ideal for applications that need to process data quickly and reliably. 

For example, Redis was used in this project to store and retrieve the real-time location of drivers and orders, as well as the status of orders and drivers, to ensure that orders were routed to the nearest available driver.

### Integration Test

**Generated integration test suites on Postman and documented the entire endpoints with test cases and examples.** 

For example, I wrote test cases to validate the response structure of the endpoints and their accuracy when different parameters were sent in the request.

### **Regression Test** 

**Implemented regression tests by creating UI automation tests (E2E) for iOS and web clients to verify the functionality of the product across multiple devices and old versions.** 

The regression tests were designed to ensure that new features did not introduce any bugs into the existing codebase, and that existing features were still functioning correctly after a new release. This was done by running the new code through a series of tests and verifying that the expected results were obtained.

Here are some of the common challenges that people may encounter when learning Redis:

1. In-memory data store: One of the key features of Redis is that it stores data in memory, which makes it fast, but also requires a sufficient amount of memory to run effectively. This can be a challenge for some users, as it may require adjusting their hardware or infrastructure to accommodate Redis.
2. Data persistence: Redis supports persistence, which allows data to be saved to disk and loaded back into memory, but it can be challenging to configure and manage persistence effectively. Users must consider factors such as performance, reliability, and disk space usage when setting up persistence.
3. Data structure selection: Redis supports multiple data structures, such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets, and it can be challenging to choose the right data structure for a given use case. Users must understand the strengths and limitations of each data structure in order to use Redis effectively.
4. Concurrency: Redis is designed to handle high levels of concurrency, but it can still be challenging to manage concurrent access to data in a multi-threaded environment. Users must understand the Redis locking mechanism and be careful to avoid race conditions and deadlocks.
5. Cluster configuration: Redis supports clustering, which allows data to be distributed across multiple nodes
